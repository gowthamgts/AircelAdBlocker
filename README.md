About AircelAdBlocker
---------------------
AircelAdBlocker is a long term necessity due to those irritating in-call ads from Aircel. I almost hated it and I wanted to do something about it. Also, I had a good time of a month to implement the project and I started it. This is my first Android app and hence I also decided it to release it under **GNU GPL license**. Enough with the history let's get down to business.
